// This file is responsible for managing the global state related to stores.
// It will be consumed by components like StoreSelector.tsx and StoreComparison.tsx.
// Best practice: Memoize the context value to prevent unnecessary re-renders of consumers.
// Fetch store data asynchronously and provide loading/error states.
