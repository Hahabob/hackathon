// This file is responsible for managing the global state of the shopping cart.
// It will be consumed by components like ShoppingCart.tsx, ProductCard.tsx, and CartItem.tsx.
// Best practice: Use the useReducer hook for complex state logic.
// Persist the cart state to localStorage to prevent data loss on page refresh.
