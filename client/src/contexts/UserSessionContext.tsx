// This file is responsible for managing the user's session and authentication state.
// It will be consumed by components that require user information or authentication, like AdminPanel.tsx or Header.tsx.
// Best practice: Store authentication tokens securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies).
// Provide methods for login, logout, and checking authentication status.
