// This file contains a custom React hook for fetching data from an API.
// It will be used by components to simplify data fetching logic, including loading and error states.
// It will likely use the api.ts utility for making the actual requests.
// Best practice: Make the hook generic so it can be reused for different data types.
// Handle caching and re-fetching logic appropriately.
