// This file defines the TypeScript interface for a store's layout, including product zones.
// It is used by MapCanvas.tsx and ProductZone.tsx to render the store map.
// Best practice: Use a structured format like GeoJSON or a custom format that is easy to parse.
// This will help in accurately representing the store layout.
