// This file contains mock traffic data for simulating store crowdedness or other dynamic factors.
// It can be used to test features like route optimization under different conditions.
// The data structure should be designed to be easily integrated with the store layout and routing logic.
// Best practice: Use this to simulate real-world scenarios during development.
