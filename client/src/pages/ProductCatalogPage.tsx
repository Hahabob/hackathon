// This file is responsible for displaying a grid or list of products.
// It will interact with ProductCard.tsx to render individual products and may use CartContext.tsx to add items to the cart.
// Best practice: Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large product sets.
// Consider memoizing product components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
