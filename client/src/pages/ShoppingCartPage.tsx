// This file is responsible for displaying the contents of the user's shopping cart.
// It will interact with CartItem.tsx to render individual cart items and CartContext.tsx to manage cart state.
// Best practice: Allow users to easily modify item quantities or remove items from the cart.
// Clearly display the subtotal, taxes, and total.
