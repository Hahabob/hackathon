// This file is responsible for calculating the most efficient route through a store to collect all items in the cart.
// It will interact with the cart contents (from CartContext) and the store layout (from StoreContext).
// Best practice: Implement a well-known algorithm like the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) heuristic.
// Consider running the calculation in a web worker to avoid blocking the UI.
