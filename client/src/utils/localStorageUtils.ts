// This file provides utility functions for interacting with the browser's localStorage.
// It will be used by contexts like CartContext.tsx to persist state.
// Best practice: Handle potential errors when reading from or writing to localStorage (e.g., if it's disabled).
// Use a consistent keying strategy to avoid conflicts.
