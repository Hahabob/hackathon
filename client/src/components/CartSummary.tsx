// This file is responsible for displaying a summary of the shopping cart.
// It will interact with CartContext.tsx to get the cart's subtotal, taxes, and total.
// Best practice: Keep this component simple and focused on displaying the final costs.
// Include a clear call-to-action button for checkout.
