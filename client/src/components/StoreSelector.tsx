// This file is responsible for allowing users to select a store for pickup or delivery.
// It will interact with StoreCard.tsx to display store options and StoreContext.tsx to manage the selected store.
// Best practice: Display stores on a map or in a list with relevant information like address and hours.
// Automatically suggest the nearest store based on user's location.
