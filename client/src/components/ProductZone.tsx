// This file is responsible for visualizing product locations or zones within a store on the map.
// It will receive layout and product data and interact with MapCanvas.tsx to draw on the map.
// Best practice: Use distinct colors or icons to represent different product categories or zones.
// Ensure the zones are interactive (e.g., show a tooltip on hover).
