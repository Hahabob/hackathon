// This file is responsible for the application's main header.
// It will contain the logo, navigation, and possibly a search bar or user profile icon.
// It will interact with Navigation.tsx and UserSessionContext.tsx.
// Best practice: Keep the header clean and uncluttered.
// Ensure it is responsive and works well on all screen sizes.
