// This file is responsible for allowing users to share their shopping cart with others.
// It will interact with CartContext.tsx to get the cart data and generate a shareable link or code.
// Best practice: Provide multiple sharing options (e.g., link, social media, email).
// Ensure the shared cart can be easily imported by another user.
